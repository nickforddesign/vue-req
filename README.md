## Options

### headers [Object]
Headers can contain any custom headers you'd like to include in your requests. The values can be literals, or functions. Use functions for values that may change over time, such as Vuex getters.

### before [Function]
Before hook to fire before each request. The hook uses async/await, so asynchronous hooks will complete before the actual request is made. This is particularly useful for checking if you have expired tokens and refreshing them before a request.

### timeout [Function]
Timeout hook to fire in the event of a timeout.

### timeout_duration [Number]
Duration in ms for fetch timeout limit.
